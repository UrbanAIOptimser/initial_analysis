### Bike Share Data
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, you will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

The Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

Gender
Birth Year

Data for the first 10 rides in the new_york_city.csv file

The original files are much larger and messier, and you don't need to download them, but they can be accessed here if you'd like to see them (Chicago, New York City, Washington). These files had more columns and they differed in format in many cases. Some data wrangling has been performed to condense these files to the above core six columns to make your analysis and the evaluation of your Python skills more straightforward. In the Data Wrangling course that comes later in the Data Analyst Nanodegree program, students learn how to wrangle the dirtiest, messiest datasets, so don't worry, you won't miss out on learning this important skill!

Statistics Computed
You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:

1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day

2 Popular stations and trip
most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

3 Trip duration
total travel time
average travel time

4 User info
counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
The Files
To answer these questions using Python, you will need to write a Python script. To help guide your work in this project, a template with helper code and comments is provided in a bikeshare.py file, and you will do your scripting in there also. You will need the three city dataset files too:

chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv

All four of these files are zipped up in the Bikeshare file in the resource tab in the sidebar on the left side of this page. You may download and open up that zip file to do your project work on your local machine.


### NYC Traffic Accidents
Motor vehicle collisions reported by the New York City Police Department from January-August 2020. Each record represents an individual collision, including the date, time and location of the accident (borough, zip code, street name, latitude/longitude), vehicles and victims involved, and contributing factors.

Recommended Analysis
Compare the % of total accidents by month. Do you notice any seasonal patterns?
Break down accident frequency by day of week and hour of day. Based on this data, when do accidents occur most frequently?
On which particular street were the most accidents reported? What does that represent as a % of all reported accidents?
What was the most common contributing factor for the accidents reported in this sample (based on Vehicle 1)? What about for fatal accidents specifically?


### Transportation Dataset

DESCRIPTION
This table contains data on the percent of residents aged 16 years and older mode of transportation to work for …

SUMMARY
This table contains data on the percent of residents aged 16 years and older mode of transportation to work for California, its regions, counties, cities/towns, and census tracts. Data is from the U.S. Census Bureau, Decennial Census and American Community Survey. The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity. Commute trips to work represent 19% of travel miles in the United States. The predominant mode – the automobile - offers extraordinary personal mobility and independence, but it is also associated with health hazards, such as air pollution, motor vehicle crashes, pedestrian injuries and fatalities, and sedentary lifestyles. Automobile commuting has been linked to stress-related health problems. Active modes of transport – bicycling and walking alone and in combination with public transit – offer opportunities for physical activity, which is associated with lowering rates of heart disease and stroke, diabetes, colon and breast cancer, dementia and depression. Risk of injury and death in collisions are higher in urban areas with more concentrated vehicle and pedestrian activity. Bus and rail passengers have a lower risk of injury in collisions than motorcyclists, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Minority communities bear a disproportionate share of pedestrian-car fatalities; Native American male pedestrians experience four times the death rate Whites or Asian pedestrians, and African-Americans and Latinos experience twice the rate as Whites or Asians. More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.

### Pollution_Random
This dataset is generated by ChatGPT using Random Package
Pollution prediction is a valuable application in environmental science and public health. It aims to forecast the levels of various pollutants in the air, water, or soil at specific locations and time intervals. The primary uses and benefits of pollution prediction include:

Environmental Monitoring: Pollution prediction helps monitor and assess the current and future levels of pollutants in the environment. It enables authorities and researchers to understand the extent of pollution, identify hotspots, and track pollution trends over time.

Health Risk Assessment: Predicting pollution levels can provide insights into the potential health risks associated with exposure to pollutants. By understanding the anticipated pollution levels, authorities can issue health advisories and take preventive measures to protect vulnerable populations.

Urban Planning and Policy Making: Pollution prediction models contribute to urban planning efforts by considering the potential environmental impacts of infrastructure projects, land use changes, and transportation systems. This information helps policymakers make informed decisions to minimize pollution and promote sustainable development.

Emergency Response and Preparedness: During events such as industrial accidents, wildfires, or natural disasters, pollution prediction can assist in emergency response planning. By forecasting pollutant dispersion patterns, authorities can take appropriate measures to evacuate affected areas, protect public health, and mitigate the immediate and long-term environmental consequences.

Air Quality Management: Pollution prediction is crucial for air quality management programs. It aids in the identification of pollution sources, evaluation of emission reduction strategies, and the design of effective control measures to improve air quality and comply with regulatory standards.


### Air Quality in Biggest Cities of the World

Pollutant from Dataset
PM2.5 (Particulate Matter 2.5 micrometers or smaller): PM2.5 refers to fine particles suspended in the air with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller. These particles can come from various sources such as vehicle emissions, industrial processes, and natural sources like dust and pollen. PM2.5 particles can penetrate deep into the respiratory system and have adverse effects on human health.

O3 (Ozone): Ground-level ozone is a reactive gas formed when sunlight reacts with pollutants like volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). It is a major component of smog and can cause respiratory problems, especially in sensitive individuals like children, the elderly, and people with respiratory conditions.

NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide): Nitrogen dioxide is a reddish-brown gas primarily emitted from vehicle exhaust and combustion processes in industries and power plants. It can irritate the respiratory system and contribute to the formation of smog and acid rain.

PM10 (Particulate Matter 10 micrometers or smaller): PM10 refers to larger particles with a diameter of 10 micrometers or smaller. These particles include both fine and coarse particles, originating from sources like construction activities, road dust, and industrial processes. While they are not as fine as PM2.5, they can still have health impacts when inhaled.

SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide): Sulfur dioxide is a gas produced by burning fossil fuels, especially those containing sulfur, like coal and oil. It can lead to respiratory issues and contribute to the formation of acid rain, which can have detrimental effects on the environment and human-made structures.

These pollutants are often monitored as part of air quality assessments to ensure public health and environmental protection. Regulatory agencies and organizations establish air quality standards and guidelines to limit the concentration of these pollutants in the atmosphere to reduce their negative impacts.

Source names from Dataset:
ChinaAQIData: ChinaAQIData refers to the Air Quality Index (AQI) used in China to assess and communicate the level of air pollution. It takes into account various pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and carbon monoxide (CO). The AQI is typically divided into different categories (e.g., Good, Moderate, Unhealthy) to inform the public about air quality conditions and associated health risks.

AirNow: AirNow is a United States government-operated platform that provides real-time and forecasted air quality information to the public. It offers an AQI calculation based on various pollutants and includes color-coded categories to help people understand air quality conditions in their area.

caaqm (Centralized Air Quality Monitoring): Caaqm refers to the centralized air quality monitoring system used in various regions to monitor air pollution levels. This system typically involves a network of monitoring stations that measure pollutants and report data to regulatory agencies. It helps in assessing compliance with air quality standards and making informed policy decisions.

EEA Spain: EEA stands for the European Environment Agency. EEA Spain refers to the air quality monitoring and reporting activities specific to Spain under the umbrella of the European Union. The EEA compiles air quality data from various European countries to assess air quality trends and inform policies aimed at improving air quality and reducing pollution.

EEA Germany: Similarly, EEA Germany refers to the air quality monitoring and reporting activities specific to Germany within the European Union. It involves data collection, analysis, and reporting on air quality conditions in Germany to contribute to the overall understanding of air pollution in Europe.

These platforms and systems play a crucial role in informing the public, policymakers, and researchers about air quality conditions and trends, promoting awareness and action to address air pollution and its impacts.

About Units in Dataset:
µg/m³ and ppm are units of measurement commonly used to express concentrations of substances in the air. They are often used to quantify the amount of pollutants or gases present in the atmosphere. Here's what each unit means:

µg/m³ (micrograms per cubic meter):
This unit measures the concentration of a substance in the air by indicating the mass of that substance per unit volume of air. It is used to express the amount of particulate matter or solid particles suspended in the air. Micrograms (µg) are a unit of mass, and cubic meters (m³) are a unit of volume. So, when you see a value like "10 µg/m³," it means there are 10 micrograms of the substance in every cubic meter of air.

ppm (parts per million):
PPM is a unit used to express the concentration of a substance in a gaseous mixture. It indicates the number of parts of a particular substance per one million parts of the total mixture by volume. This unit is often used for gases such as pollutants, gases in the atmosphere, or trace elements. For example, if the concentration of a gas is 1 ppm, it means that there is one part of that gas for every one million parts of the mixture.

Both units are essential for assessing air quality and environmental monitoring, especially in areas where the presence of pollutants or gases can have health or ecological impacts. Different substances might have different recommended exposure limits in these units to ensure human and environmental safety.
